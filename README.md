Here a picture of a synthetic SP and the treated SP, here my idea was to check the fit

Here a picture of the gap plot to measure the impact of the investment in marketing

To finish the placebo test to have an answer if investment in market brought more sales. The black line is the gap from the real SP and the synthetic SP the rest of the lines are the other states taking into account gap from real and synthetic per state. Clearly we can see that before the treatment the difference is close to 0 units however after the treatment the amount of sales goes above 100 units, the results can only be seen in SP as expected.

***Main goal of the project is to work wirh causal inference and possibly applying the same investment that are similar to SP**.
